      "Literature Summary: The prevalence of COVID-19 in the United States varies across studies, with a pooled prevalence of 0.31% from a meta-analysis of patients with post-COVID-19 conditions (Chen et al., 2021). A study examining county-level greenspace exposure found a reduced risk of COVID-19 mortality associated with higher greenspace, particularly LAI deciles 8-10 (Abedi et al., 2020). However, racial and ethnic minority groups, particularly African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians, had higher risks of positivity and severe outcomes compared to White individuals (WHO Health Emergency Dashboard, 2021). A study on dental hygienists reported a low prevalence of 3.1% among practitioners, with mental health symptoms being elevated (Estrich et al., 2020). A descriptive analysis of COVID-19-related deaths found increased risk factors for cardiovascular disease (Ahmad & Anderson, 2021) and a prevalence of 1.7% during the peak of stay-at-home orders (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). A meta-analysis of vaccine hesitancy found 61% of participants willing to receive the vaccine, with higher rates among Black and Republican respondents (Kirzinger et al., 2021). A cross-sectional analysis in adolescents and youth showed a higher prevalence compared to older adults (Dong et al., 2020).\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: The prevalence of COVID-19 in the United States ranges from 0.31% to 1.7% across studies, with disparities among racial and ethnic groups, and a lower prevalence among dental hygienists during the pandemic.\n",
